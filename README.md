# Bannergress GPX Export

## Overview

This plugin adds a button to detail page of a banner in [Bannergress](https://bannergress.com/) that allows downloading a GPX file with the route of the banner. The GPX file format can be used to import the route in applications like Komoot, Garmin, Google Maps, etc. for extended route planning.

When the plugin is enabled, the download button with text "GPX" appears on banner detail pages in the map section below the zoom buttons.

## Build

The source file bannergress-gpx-export.user.js can directly be used as plugin in Tampermonkey or similar browser extensions.
